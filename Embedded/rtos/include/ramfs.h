/**
    This header file declares the interface to some simple library
    routines suitable for handling RAMFS contained in the
    AVR micro controllers.

    - All of the read/write functions first make sure the RAMFS is
    ready to be accessed.  Since this may cause long delays if a
    write operation is still pending, time-critical applications
    should first poll the RAMFS e. g. using ramfs_is_ready() before
    attempting any actual I/O.

    - As these functions modify IO registers, they are known to be
    non-reentrant.  If any of these functions are used from both,
    standard and interrupt context, the applications must ensure
    proper protection (e.g. by disabling interrupts before accessing
    them).
