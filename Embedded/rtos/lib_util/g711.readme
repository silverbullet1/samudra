       =============================================================


The UGST G711 module, version 3.01 (31.Jan.2000) needs the following
files:

g711.c .......... G711 module itself; needs the prototypes in G711.H.
g711demo.c ...... Demonstration program for the G711 module; needs the files 
                  g711.c and ugstdemo.h in the current directory.
ugstdemo.h ...... prototypes and definitions needed by UGST demo programs.
g711.h .......... prototypes and definitions needed by the G711 module.

As an auxiliary program, there is:
shiftbit.c ...... program to shift (with sign extension) to left or right the
                  input file, saving in the output file. You may need this if
                  you speech data file has less than 16 bit resolution and not
                  left-justified.

Makefiles:
~~~~~~~~~~
Makefiles have been provided for automatic build-up of the executable program
and to process the test files:
makefile.unx .... makefile for compiling on an Unix environment
makefile.tcc .... makefile for compiling with MSDOS Borland [bt]cc
makefile.cl ..... makefile for compiling with MS Visual C compiler
makefile.djc .... makefile for compiling with DJGPP MSDOS port of gcc
make-vms.com .... DCL for compiling in the VAX/VMS environment

Testing:
~~~~~~~~
The provided makefiles can run a portability test on the demo program. They 
need the archive tst-g711.zip ([pk]zip compatible archive) and [pk]unzip to 
extract the proper source and reference processed files. The contents of this
archive file is:
sweep.src ....... THE reference file
sweep-r.a ....... reference file: sweep.src encoded by A-law (A lilo)
sweep-r.a-a ..... reference file: sweep-r.a decoded by A-law (A loli)
sweep-r.rea ..... reference file: sweep.src enc'd *and* decoded by A-law (lili)
sweep-r.u ....... reference file: sweep.src enc'd by u-law (u lilo)
sweep-r.u-u ..... reference file: sweep-r.u dec'd by u-law (u loli)
sweep-r.reu ..... reference file: sweep.src enc'd *and* decoded by u-law (lili)

NOTE! These files are in the big-endian (high-byte first) format. Therefore, 
      before using under MSDOS or VAX/VMS, the files need to be byte-swapped. 
      See unsupported program sb in the ../unsup directory.
      The CRC-32 (unsup utility crc) for each of the test files are
      given below:

      File name       CRC32-BE  CRC32-LE  Size
      ------------------------------------------
      sweep-r.a       E714C343  74719FE4  131072
      sweep-r.a-a     1595D5BA  ABCEAA69  131072
      sweep-r.rea     1595D5BA  ABCEAA69  131072
      sweep-r.reu     D6812645  63641C01  131072
      sweep-r.u       E7513B35  CD170E15  131072
      sweep-r.u-u     D6812645  63641C01  131072
      sweep.src       67B11DDE  C8BA7682  131072
      ------------------------------------------
      Notes:
      - CRC32-BE: CRC-32 for the big endian format (i.e., most 
        non-Intel Unix systems)
      - CRC32-LE: CRC-32 for the little endian format (Intel CPUs, etc)
      - Size: file size, in bytes
