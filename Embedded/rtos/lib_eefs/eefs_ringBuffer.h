/** \ingroup Group_MiscDrivers
 *  \defgroup Group_RingBuff Generic Byte Ring Buffer - LUFA/Drivers/Misc/RingBuffer.h
 *  \brief Lightweight ring buffer, for fast insertion/deletion of bytes.
 *
 *  \section Sec_RingBuff_Dependencies Module Source Dependencies
 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *    - None
 *
 *  \section Sec_RingBuff_ModDescription Module Description
 *  Lightweight ring buffer, for fast insertion/deletion. Multiple buffers can be created of
 *  different sizes to suit different needs.
 *
 *  Note that for each buffer, insertion and removal operations may occur at the same time (via
 *  a multi-threaded ISR based system) however the same kind of operation (two or more insertions
 *  or deletions) must not overlap. If there is possibility of two or more of the same kind of
 *  operating occurring at the same point in time, atomic (mutex) locking should be used.
 *
 *  \section Sec_RingBuff_ExampleUsage Example Usage
 *  The following snippet is an example of how this module may be used within a typical
 *  application.
 *
 *  \code
 *      // Create the buffer structure and its underlying storage array
 *      eefs_ringBuffer_t buffer;
 *      uint8_t      bufferData[128];
 *
 *      // Initialize the buffer with the created storage array
 *      eefs_ringBuffer_InitBuffer(&buffer, bufferData, sizeof(bufferData));
 *
 *      // Insert some data into the buffer
 *      eefs_ringBuffer_Poke(&buffer, 'H');
 *      eefs_ringBuffer_Poke(&buffer, 'E');
 *      eefs_ringBuffer_Poke(&buffer, 'L');
 *      eefs_ringBuffer_Poke(&buffer, 'L');
 *      eefs_ringBuffer_Poke(&buffer, 'O');
 *
 *      // Cache the number of stored bytes in the buffer
 *      uint16_t BufferCount = eefs_ringBuffer_GetCount(&buffer);
 *
 *      // Printer stored data length
 *      printf("buffer Length: %d, Buffer Data: \r\n", BufferCount);
 *
 *      // Print contents of the buffer one character at a time
 *      while (BufferCount--)
 *        putc(eefs_ringBuffer_Pop(&buffer));
 *  \endcode
