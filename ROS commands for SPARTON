INSTRUCTIONS TO SETUP AHRS-8 with ROS.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1)First create catkin_ws.

2)Create a folder named src inside that.

3)Copy SpartonCompassIMU folder inside that.

4)Make sure you're at catkin_ws directory. Go to devel folder.
Type ". setup.sh" (quotes for clarification). Note that You need to do this everytime, so just add this step to your bashrc file :)
and finally run catkin_make. EDIT : Well NO. You can't source from multiple workspaces so easily, you need to overlay first over 2nd,
2nd over 3rd and finally include 3rd. So just do this step everytime unfortunately.

5)Now open a terminal and type "roscore &". Note the use of ampersand here. According to the official documentation of Linux, If a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell. The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.
In other words: adding the '&' allows you to continue to use the terminal, while roscore is running in the background. If you did not add the '&', roscore would start and all input (into the terminal window) would be directed to roscore. You'd need a second terminal to do your work in.

6)Sometimes you may encounter an error like, rosmaster is already running,etc. Then you need to terminate it manually. Termination of background tasks can be tricky. You could use pkill: pkill roscore. Note that this will kill the first roscore process that it matches.

7)Now run "roslaunch sparton AHRS-8.launch"
The terminal should come to a hault after displaying some lines.

8)Now open up another terminal and type in "rqt". Go to plugins->Topics->Topic monitor and mark imu/data. You should see all the values 
of angular velocity etc. Congratulations! Checkpoint 1 clear :)

9)Also note that, THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS, go to dev/sensors/ and note down the value of the file, mine was "ftdi_FTHBZZL6" now you
need to change this in AHRS-8.launch file and SpartonCompass.launch file as well.
